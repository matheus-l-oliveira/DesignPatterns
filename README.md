# Personal Study Repository for Dive Into Design Patterns
This repository contains my personal collection of code examples and algorithms based on the book "Dive Into Design Patterns" by Alexander Shvets. The primary purpose of this repository is to store the code I'm practicing while studying the book, making it publicly available for reference.

Introduction
"Dive Into Design Patterns" is a comprehensive guide to software design patterns, written by Alexander Shvets. The book covers various design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, providing detailed explanations and practical examples for each pattern. As I progress through the book, I will be adding code examples and algorithms to this repository, focusing on the patterns discussed in the book.
Patterns Covered
The following design patterns are covered in this repository:

### Creational Patterns
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural Patterns
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

#### Each pattern will include a dedicated folder containing the source code and a brief explanation of the pattern.
